# SQL Server Integration

SQL databases are a major source of data for data scientists. RTVS makes it
easier to work with SQL data by integrating with the excellent support for SQL
Server that is available to Visual Studio users. Since Visual Studio is modular,
you will need to first download the [SQL Server Data
Tools](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt204009.aspx) package before
you can use the R and SQL integration features described in this page.

## Support for creating and running SQL Queries

SQL statements are typically written interactively, by gradually refining the
query until the correct results are returned. To make it easier to work with SQL
Server, RTVS lets you add SQL queries to your existing projects. This lets you
work in a separate SQL-only file, focusing only on your query and the results it
generates until you get the query that you want.

Adding a new SQL query file is easy: just right-click on your project in
Solution Explorer, and select SQL Query from the Add New Item command. This
creates a file that will contain your new SQL query.

![Add SQL Query item](./media/sql-add-item.png)

The file is opened in an editor window that lets you compose your SQL query.
Here's a SQL editor window with a query entered already:

![SQL Query Window](./media/sql-query-window.png)

Before the editor can provide you with IntelliSense, or execute your query, you
must first tell the editor what database to connect that editor window to. You
can do this by clicking on the Connect button in the toolbar window, or by
attempting to execute your query. Queries can be executed by pressing
CTRL+SHIFT+E to run the entire file, or by selecting a range of text and
pressing CTRL+SHIFT+E.

If the SQL editor needs to establish a connection to the database, it will pop
up this dialog:

![SQL Connection Dialog Box](./media/sql-connection-dialog.png)

In the dialog, you must choose the Server and the Database on the server that
you want to connect to. Clicking on the Connect button will either establish a
connection to the server, or report any errors that were encountered. Once a
connection has been established, you can see the results of your query, as well
as get full IntelliSense for elements within your query (e.g., table names or
column names if you have specified the table name already in your query).

![SQL Window Query Results](./media/sql-query-results.png)

There are many other features available within the Transact-SQL editor. For
example, you can display the execution query plan for your query, which can
greatly help you diagnose why a query is running slowly:

![SQL Window Execution Query Plan](./media/sql-query-plan.png)

For more details on the many features of the Transact-SQL editor, see the
[Transact-SQL Editor Documentation on
MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh272706(v=vs.103).aspx).

## Working with SQL Server Stored Procedures

A new feature in SQL Server 2016, [SQL Server R
Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt604845.aspx), lets you
embed and run R code from your Transact-SQL stored procedures. R code can now
execute on the SQL Server machine, operating on data returned from a SQL query,
and generate a SQL result set that can be processed by further SQL or returned
to the client. However, this feature requires combining SQL code and R code
together inside of a single SQL statement, a process that is unwieldy and
error-prone as you can see below:



RTVS has a number of features that make it easier to use this feature than just
copying and pasting your R code into your Transact-SQL editor. To understand how
this works, let's break down RTVS features into several categories, and walk
through each one in turn:

1. Add a database connection to your project
1. Add a SQL stored procedure file to your project
1. Write and test your SQL stored procedure within your project
1. Publish your SQL stored procedure to your database

### Adding a database connection to your project

RTVS makes it much easier for you to add a database connection string to your
project. From the R Tools menu run the Data > Add Database Connection command.
This brings up the Connection Properties Dialog. This lets you select from a
number of key options:

1. The name of the data source, which is the database driver (SQL Server)
1. The name of the server to connect to (the local machine)
1. The authentication mode used in the connection (Windows / integrated
   authentication which uses the logged in user's credentials to make the
   connection)
1. The name of the database on the server to connect to (NYCTaxiData)

![SQL Connection Dialog](./media/sql-connection-string-dialog.png)

You can click on the Test Connection button to verify that you can successfully
connect to the database. If you have connectivity problems reaching the database
server or permissions problem accessing the database, you will see those error
messages when you click on this button.

Finally, click OK to generate the database connection string. RTVS will create a
new file, `settings.R`, that contains the database connection string in a variable
called `dbConnection`. This file is automatically sourced (run) by RTVS, so
immediately after you have created the connection you can start using it from
your R scripts:

![SQL Settings.R file](./media/sql-settings-dot-r.png)

### Adding a SQL stored procedure file to your project

RTVS has an item template for a SQL Stored Procedure. You can add one to your
project by right-clicking on your project in Solution Explorer, and running the
Add > New Item command from the context menu. Select SQL R Stored Procedure from
the list of templates, and name your new stored procedure `StoredProcedure.sql`.
RTVS will create three files on your behalf:

1. `StoredProcedure.R` is where you write the R code that you want to execute in
   your SQL stored procedure.
1. `StoredProcedure.Query.sql` is where you write the SQL code that you want to
   execute in your SQL stored procedure.
1. `StoredProcedure.Template.sql` is the generated template file that will
   combine your SQL query and your R code.

In Solution Explorer, you see these three files as a single node called
`StoredProcedure.R`. Click on the chevron to the left of the filename to see all
three files:

![Solution Explorer Expanded View Of Sql Stored Procedure](./media/sql-solution-explorer-expanded.png)

`StoredProcedure.R` is the file where you write and test the R code that you
want to run inside your SQL Stored Procedure. In the generated code, your R code
will be passed an R dataframe called `InputDataSet`. The output of your R code
will be written to from R dataframe called `OutputDataSet`. Our generated code
simply assigns OutputDataSet to InputDataset. The names of these dataframes are
controlled by the `@input_data_1_name` and `@output_data_1_name` parameters in
the call to the `sp_execute_external_script` system stored procedure.

![StoredProcedure R Generated Code](./media/sql-stored-procedure-r-generated-code.png)

For more details on the design of this calling convention and some examples of
its usage, see the SQL Server documentation on the
[sp_execute_external_script](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt604368.aspx)
system stored procedure.

When you write and test your R code, you will want to test it using data from
SQL. We generate a small test script in the comments of the `StoredProcedure.R`
file that uses the [RODBC
package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RODBC/index.html) to transmit a
SQL statement to SQL Server, run it, and retrieve its result set as an R dataframe. You can uncomments the test code to interactively write your R code against the result set that you got from SQL Server.

`StoredProcedure.Query.sql` is the file where you write and test the SQL query
that generates the data for `InputDataSet`. Since this is a `.sql` file, you
have all of the Transact-SQL editing / execution features available to you, as
described in the section above on Creating and Running SQL query. Once you are
happy with your SQL code, you can integrate it with your R code in
`StoredProcedure.R`. 

RTVS makes integrating SQL into R code easier by letting you reference the
`.sql` file that contains your SQL code from your R code. Ordinarily you would
write some R code that would open the file containing the SQL, read it into a
string, and then pass it to the RODBC package to send to SQL Server. RTVS lets
you drag your `.sql` file onto the editor that has `StoredProcedure.R` open and
it will insert the code that reads the SQL file into a string. Try it yourself;
you should see something that looks like the highlighted code when you are done:

![Reading SQL File into R String Variable](./media/sql-reference-sql-file-from-r.png)

Now you can interactively write your R code that manipulates the `InputDataSet`
dataframe until you get it right. Remember that you can always just select the
R code that you run interactively in the editor and send it to the R Interactive window by pressing CTRL+ENTER.

`StoredProcedure.Template.sql` is the file that contains the _template_ for
generating your SQL Stored Procedure. The `_RCODE_` placeholder will be replaced
by the contents of the `StoredProcedure.R` file. The `_INPUT_QUERY_` placeholder
will be replaced by the contents of the `StoredProcedure.Query.sql` file.
Finally, you will need to describe the _schema_ of the result set that is
returned from the Stored Procedure by editing the `WITH RESULT SETS` clause.
Here you will need to identify the columns from the `OutputDataSet` dataframe
that you want to return to the caller of the stored procedure. 

For example, if you had a query that looked like this:

![Sample SQL Query](./media/sql-sample-sql-query.png)

You will use the following `WITH RESULT SETS` clause to specify the data types
of the return values:

![Template File With Result Sets Clause](./media/sql-template-with-result-sets.png)

Finally, when you are ready to publish your completed stored procedure to SQL
Server, you can run the Data > Publish With Options command from the R Tools
menu. Here, you will specify that you want to publish to the database, and RTVS
will build and publish your new stored procedure to SQL Server:

![Publish Stored Procedure](./media/sql-publish-with-options.png)

If you have the SQL Server Object Explorer open in Visual Studio, you will see
your published stored procedure in the Programmability / Stored Procedures
folder of your database:

![SQL Object Explorer showing new stored procedure](./media/sql-object-explorer.png)

You can even directly execute it from the Object Explorer by right-clicking on
it and running the Execute Procedure command, or by calling it interactively
from a `.sql` query window.

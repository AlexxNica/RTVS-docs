# History Window

We now have a History window that shows all of the commands that you have typed
into the R Interactive Window. If you want to 'replay' a command, double-click
on the line in the History Window that you want to send to the R Interactive
Window. You will need to press ENTER in the R Interactive Window to actually run
the command. One notable feature of the R History Window is that it supports
multi-line mode (enabled by default). In this mode, we will send a multi-line
statement (e.g., a function definition) in its entirety to the R Interactive
Window when you double click on it:

If you don't like this multi-line functionality, you can always turn it off by
clicking on the icon on the far right of the R History toolbar. You also have
the option to save your history, load a previous history from a file, send a
command to the R Interactive Window or the active editor, as well as clearing
all the entries in the History Window.

# Install R Tools for Visual Studio

## Prerequisites

RTVS can be installed in the following editions of Visual Studio:

* [Visual Studio 2015 Update 1 or higher](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs2015-update1-vs)

## Quick Start: Installation:

1. You must have **Visual Studio 2015 Update 1** or higher installed on your machine. Earlier versions of Visual Studio are not supported.
2. You may download Community Edition if you donâ€™t already have a copy of Professional or Enterprise.
3. **Please (you must) uninstall any previous versions of RTVS that you may have on your machine.**
4. Install RTVS from: **\\\pytools\release\rtvs\preview3.1\rtvs.exe**
5. Select the Data Science mode when prompted during installation.

## A complete and perpetually free R IDE

The R Tools for Visual Studio 2015 extension is completely free, and there are several free Visual Studio editions that can use it.

* [Visual Studio 2015](http://visualstudio.com)
 * Community Edition
 * Express for Web
 * Express for Desktop

We recommend using **Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition**, which is the most powerful and has the best extension support. The Express for Web editions are focused on web development and have fewer features, while Express for Desktop includes C++ and features for native development but no web support.

This layout is quite similar to RStudio, so it should be quite familiar for current RStudio users.

### Streamlined data scientist window layout settings command

In response to feedback, we have created a new top-level command to reset Visual Studio to a simpler set of toolbars and menus that is more appropriate for the Data Scientist workflow. You can do this through the R new **Tools** | **Data Science Settings** command:

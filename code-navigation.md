# Code Navigation

You can now navigate to the definition of another function within the same file
using the GoTo Definition command from the context menu, or by placing your
cursor over a call to the function and pressing F12. Note that this feature only
works today within the same file; send us feedback if you feel multi-file
navigation is an important feature and we will prioritize and add to a future
release.

If you would prefer instead to _peek_ at the definition of a function, you can
do so by using the Peek Definition command from the context menu, or by placing
your cursor over a call to the function and pressing ALT+F12:
